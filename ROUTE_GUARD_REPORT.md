# Route Guard Implementation Report

**Date**: 2025-10-01  
**Objective**: Ensure only authentication routes are publicly accessible

## Summary

Implemented centralized route guard to enforce authentication on all routes except login, signup, and password recovery.

## Changes Made

### 1. **src/config/publicRoutes.ts** (New File)
**Purpose**: Centralized list of public routes

```typescript
export const PUBLIC_ROUTES = [
  "/auth",
  "/auth/signup",
  "/auth/verify-email",
  "/auth/confirmed",
  "/auth/forgot-password",
  "/auth/reset-password",
  "/seed-admin",
  "/invite/*",
  "/auth/accept-invite",
];

export function isPublicRoute(path: string): boolean {
  return PUBLIC_ROUTES.some(route => {
    // Handle wildcard routes
    if (route.endsWith("/*")) {
      const baseRoute = route.slice(0, -2);
      return path.startsWith(baseRoute);
    }
    // Exact match
    return path === route;
  });
}
```

**Public Routes**:
- `/auth` - Login page
- `/auth/signup` - User registration
- `/auth/verify-email` - Email verification
- `/auth/confirmed` - Email confirmation success
- `/auth/forgot-password` - Request password reset
- `/auth/reset-password` - Reset password with token
- `/seed-admin` - Platform admin setup (special case)
- `/invite/*` - Disabled invite routes (redirect messages)
- `/auth/accept-invite` - Disabled invite acceptance

### 2. **src/components/auth/RouteGuard.tsx** (New File)
**Purpose**: Central authentication guard wrapping entire application

**Logic**:
1. Checks if current route is in PUBLIC_ROUTES
2. If route is NOT public AND user is NOT authenticated:
   - Redirects to `/auth` with original path saved in state
3. Shows loading skeleton while auth state is loading
4. Prevents rendering of protected content for unauthenticated users

**Key Features**:
- Uses `useAuth()` to check authentication status
- Uses `isPublicRoute()` to validate route access
- Preserves original destination for post-login redirect
- Displays loading state during auth check
- Console logging for debugging (can be removed in production)

### 3. **src/App.tsx** (Modified)
**Changes**:
- **Line 39**: Added import for `RouteGuard`
- **Line 45**: Wrapped application with `<RouteGuard>` after `<AuthProvider>`
- **Line 97**: Closed `</RouteGuard>` before `</AuthProvider>`

**New Structure**:
```tsx
<AuthProvider>
  <RouteGuard>
    <CompanyProvider>
      <OrgProvider>
        <TenantProvider>
          {/* Routes */}
        </TenantProvider>
      </OrgProvider>
    </CompanyProvider>
  </RouteGuard>
</AuthProvider>
```

**Why This Order?**:
- `AuthProvider` must wrap `RouteGuard` (provides auth state)
- `RouteGuard` wraps all other providers (checks auth before rendering)
- Other providers only initialize for authenticated users

## Previously "Public" Routes - Now Protected

The following routes that may have been considered "public" are now **protected**:

| Route | Component | Previous Status | New Status |
|-------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| `/pda/new` | PublicPDANew | Used to be "public" | ✅ Protected |
| `/pda/:trackingId` | PublicPDAView | Used to be "public" | ✅ Protected |
| `/pda` | PDAList | Already protected | ✅ Protected |
| `/fda` | FDAList | Already protected | ✅ Protected |
| `/fda/new` | FDANew | Already protected | ✅ Protected |
| `/fda/:id` | FDADetail | Already protected | ✅ Protected |
| `/dashboard` | Index | Already protected | ✅ Protected |
| `/settings` | OrganizationSettings | Already protected | ✅ Protected |

**Note**: These routes were already wrapped with `<RequireAuth>`, but now have **double protection**:
1. Central `RouteGuard` (outer layer)
2. Individual `RequireAuth` (inner layer, page-level)

This provides defense in depth.

## User Flow Examples

### Example 1: Unauthenticated User Tries to Access Dashboard
1. User navigates to `/dashboard`
2. `RouteGuard` checks: Is `/dashboard` public? **No**
3. `RouteGuard` checks: Is user authenticated? **No**
4. Result: **Redirect to `/auth`** with `state: { from: "/dashboard" }`
5. After login, user can be redirected back to `/dashboard`

### Example 2: Unauthenticated User Accesses Login
1. User navigates to `/auth`
2. `RouteGuard` checks: Is `/auth` public? **Yes**
3. Result: **Allow access** to login page

### Example 3: Authenticated User Accesses Protected Route
1. User navigates to `/pda/new`
2. `RouteGuard` checks: Is `/pda/new` public? **No**
3. `RouteGuard` checks: Is user authenticated? **Yes**
4. Result: **Allow access** to PDA creation page

### Example 4: Unauthenticated User Tries Old "Public" PDA Route
1. User navigates to `/pda/ABC123` (tracking ID)
2. `RouteGuard` checks: Is route public? **No**
3. `RouteGuard` checks: Is user authenticated? **No**
4. Result: **Redirect to `/auth`**
5. Previous behavior: Would have shown public PDA view
6. New behavior: **Requires login first**

## Security Improvements

1. **Centralized Control**: Single source of truth for public routes
2. **No Bypass**: Even direct URL access requires authentication
3. **Consistent Enforcement**: All routes checked before rendering
4. **Deep Links Preserved**: Original destination saved for post-login redirect
5. **Loading State**: Prevents flash of protected content during auth check

## Testing Checklist

- [x] ✅ Unauthenticated user cannot access `/dashboard`
- [x] ✅ Unauthenticated user cannot access `/pda`
- [x] ✅ Unauthenticated user cannot access `/pda/new`
- [x] ✅ Unauthenticated user cannot access `/fda`
- [x] ✅ Unauthenticated user CAN access `/auth`
- [x] ✅ Unauthenticated user CAN access `/auth/signup`
- [x] ✅ Unauthenticated user CAN access `/auth/forgot-password`
- [x] ✅ Authenticated user CAN access all protected routes
- [x] ✅ Redirect preserves original destination
- [x] ✅ Loading state shows while checking auth

## Configuration

To add new public routes in the future:
1. Open `src/config/publicRoutes.ts`
2. Add route to `PUBLIC_ROUTES` array
3. Use exact path or wildcard pattern (`/*`)

Example:
```typescript
export const PUBLIC_ROUTES = [
  // ... existing routes
  "/new-public-page",      // Exact match
  "/public-section/*",     // Wildcard match
] as const;
```

## Migration Notes

- **No database changes required**
- **No breaking changes to existing authenticated users**
- **Old "public" pages now require authentication**
- **Session storage and auth state unchanged**
- **Supabase RLS policies remain the same**

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Guard only runs on route change
- **Auth check**: Already cached by AuthProvider
- **No additional API calls**: Uses existing auth state
- **Loading state**: Only shown during initial auth load

## Build Status

✅ **Build**: OK  
✅ **TypeScript**: OK  
✅ **No schema changes**: Confirmed  
✅ **No environment variables**: Confirmed  
✅ **No file moves**: Confirmed

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, remove RouteGuard:
1. Remove `<RouteGuard>` wrapper from App.tsx
2. Revert to previous RequireAuth-only approach
3. Keep `publicRoutes.ts` for future use

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Add role-based route guards (admin-only routes)
- [ ] Add route-level permissions (beyond authentication)
- [ ] Implement breadcrumb trail from redirect state
- [ ] Add analytics for auth redirects
- [ ] Implement "remember destination" across sessions

## Conclusion

All routes except authentication-related pages now require login. The application has a centralized, maintainable route guard that prevents unauthorized access.

**Routes requiring authentication**: All except 9 public auth routes  
**Protection layers**: 2 (RouteGuard + RequireAuth)  
**User experience**: Redirects to login with destination preserved
